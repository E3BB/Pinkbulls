This is the game outline and my plan for making it.

	Firstly, what is this "Pinkbulls" game?
Well, thanks for asking. Pinkbulls is a game with two parts. The first one is where you run around squirting dogs with a drink called "Pinkbull", which makes the dogs float to 1000m. P.S., the dogs are squirted because they have a fart toxic to all life on earth, activated once every millenia. Also, it makes them pink. After they float in the sky and fart, you have to squirt all the dogs with "Yellowrum", which dissolves Pinkbull.

	Okay. Sounds cool, but what's the plot?
I told you most of it already.

	What are the game mechanics?
Well, I'll split it into parts one and two:

One:
- Pinkbull gun: Has upward arc, makes dogs float
- Cloud-jumpers: Boots with Pinkbull and Yellowrum soles [You can jump mid-air, but only _ times per lab trip]
- Dog spit: Dogs can spit at you like llamas. Hard. Avoid it, else your gravity filps and you need cloud-jumpers.
- Platforms everywhere to jump off of
- Hang-gliding stations & Elevators: The earth's not even
- Labs: Refuel your boots and your gun. Also checkpoint
- Conspirists & Eco-Warriors: Conspirists send Eco-warriors at you. Eco-warriors try to shoot you with Pinkbull. Use plastic shield.
- WHO Headquarters: Where you end part one. Wait there for a couple days before part two.

Two:
- Sky-Elevator: Gets you up to cloud level [1000m]
- Cloud-jumpers: Uses hydrogen soles instead. Pressurize w/ air to go down
- Yellowrum gun: Used to dissolve pinkbull slowly
- Weather balloons: Has refuel, checkpoint too
- Net: Use to swing off of dogs, or to drag them to voids
- Acid Reflux dogs: They sneeze acid at you. Shield is one time
- Umbrella: Fly down, Mary Poppins style at the end

	Very cool... Is there anything that might be added or cut?
Probably. The game is in early-development. Don't ask yet. I'll also change the document as I make new ideas.

	Where can I find Pinkbulls?
On Itch.io and Github [Source code]

	Will this be a pixel game, like all your others?
It will. I don't remember how to computer draw anymore. Pixel strokes are hard.
